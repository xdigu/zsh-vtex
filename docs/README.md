# Vtex Plugin

A simple zsh plugin to help with [vtex-cli commands](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-command-reference#default-commands).

I strongly recommend that you use [you-should-use](https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use) with this plugin that will remember all the aliases.

## Requirements

You should have vtex-cli to use this plugin, [see more here how to install](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-install).

## Installation

Add one of the following to your .zshrc file depending on your package manager:

### [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh):

Copy this repository to `$ZSH_CUSTOM/custom/plugins`, where `$ZSH_CUSTOM` is the directory with custom plugins of oh-my-zsh [read more](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization/):

```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/xdigu/zsh-vtex.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/vtex
```

Then add this line to your `.zshrc`. Make sure it is **before** the line `source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`.

```zsh
    plugins=(... vtex)
```

### Manual (Git Clone):

Clone this repository somewhere on your machine. This guide will assume `~/.zsh/zsh-vtex`.

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/xdigu/zsh-vtex.git ~/.zsh/zsh-vtex
```

Add the following to your `.zshrc`:

```sh
    source ~/.zsh/zsh-vtex/vtex.zsh
```

And then start a new terminal session.
